# Project Title

Digi-Folder

## Summary

Automatic Filing from own E-Mails into a folder which is used by multiple users. E-Mails and attachments should be automatically stored by customer, date and tagged. Third party should be able to find the documents and E-mails via a search mechanism.


## Background

Currently I have to file incomming documents from customers and kolleagues manually (open a databox, typing in the customer number, what kind of document it is, the date etc.). This is very time consuming. Most of the documents attached come in on a regularly/ repeating basis, e.g. the monthly managment accounts for customer xyz. If the AI-tool could screen the e-mails automaticly and assign it to the (sub-)folder of the customer would free time. The AI-tool must learn to identify the documents even if different words are used e.g. annual accounts/ Year-end financials us people use different terms for one thing.


## How is it used?

see ## Background
   


## Data sources and AI methods

The data source would be the E-Mail in-/ outbox of my team. 

AI methods
-Natural Language Processing (NLP)
-Word embeddings
-Neural network for classification


## Challenges

-Standardisation of terms used by differnt people for the same thing
-Regulatory certainty to find the documents again
-An E-Mail which includes items for different customers 

## What next?

-Speaking with inhouse IT, whether they can help me
-Learn Python myself
